# Introduction #


# Main Functionalities #

Functions Summary is the following:
## 1) Drones database ##
> If you have some Drone of Robot you can cnnect online, you can create a profile for everyone d configuration needed. These information can then be downloaded via a http connection from your own application using our SW integration possibilities.

USS grouping:

**Fixed Geographical Location:**
  * Drones
  * Automation Systems (sensors)

**Virtual space (groupes, list or directories of elements):**
  * PC
  * Servers
  * Mobile phones

## 2) Drones Operation Online ##
> Using information defined in the Drone's profile for connection, you can operate any robot using local or remote serial ports, via local ethernet or via internet. One thing you need is our "Connection and Operation Software", or you write easily your own and you only integrate our SW integration possibilities.
## 3) 3D Tracking ##
> Tracking has two posibilities. One for Drones, one for any other Personal use or vehicle using your stuff or a mobile phone. Datas only has to be sent using our "Data Streamin function" into the database. Then the visualisation is easy as well as storing long history of tracking.
## 4) 3D Route planning ##
> Route planning is created mainly for Drone usage. Other usage may be up to you. If you have good Drone, you can plan to do ie. a splendid circles in the field (your own field), or if you own a flying Drone, you can write "I love you" or any other ad to the sky now. On our page, you will find some Drone sellers allowing you to do that well. Only be sure you have good and high assurance and mainly good and peacefull intentions!
## 5) 3D Earth Zones definition ##
> During our work, we decided that it is good to define some limits for such possibilities that Drones brings to the light. You then can still write big ad as "Buy our cheese", but within a preset location. We don't wish to limit you, but a good habbit should be to define some respect of theese limits inside the drone in case it refuses to obey you as the Terminators did. Dead spiral for Drone or a parashute should be mandatory if border limit are not respected.
## 6) Data Streaming ##
> This functionality can be used for Drones or alone for Personal or Industrial use. It is nothing more than storing any nimbered values or text inside our database, indexed or not by timestamp. The values can be displayed in the graphics and you even can set up to four limit levels for value control and choose the server's reaction by sending you an email, SMS, Skype or send predefined value or string to your predefined IP adress and port almost as a pro C&C.

## 7) SW integration ##
> Functions of this site are widely supported for external usage inside any customised application where you can ask for Drone description, download your Routes, upload your Tracking and Stream your datas up&down.
> Your aplication can be uploaded to your server for your Drone or Mobile phone for your later reuse on some other PC or Mobile phone for your colegues or children.

## 8) Other ##
> We suport data file upload and download.
